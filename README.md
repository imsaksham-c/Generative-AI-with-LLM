## Code and Assignments

The `code` directory includes detailed examples for three coding assignments:

- `Summerize-Dialogue.ipynb`: Assignment cobering Prompt Engineering.
- `Fine-Tuning Lab.ipynb`: Assignment covering Instruction Fine-Tuning using LoRA.
- `RLHF Lab.ipynb`: Assignment covering Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback to align LLMs.

## Markdown

The `markdown` directory provides the same content as above but in Markdown format for easy reading directly on GitHub.
